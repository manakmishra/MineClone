Minecraft is one of the most popular games for many years now. It has popularized the use of voxels and infnite procedural world generation. After seeing some of the similar games and prototypes, I thought it would be fun to recreate Minecraft in Unity. Since I was just starting out in Game Development when I first started this project it helped me learn more about Unity and scripting in C#. **This project is still in progress.**


<!--Features-->
### Features

* Perlin noise to procedural generate world and place biomes.
* Grassland, Forests and Desert biomes (more to be added)
* Randomized Caves
* 2D and 3D clouds using reference noise map
* Simple inventory system
* Diffuse lighting similar to original game. Because of this I did not use the standard lighting system in Unity)
* Added a in-Engine texture atlas packer tool 

**NOTE:** After implementing cross-chunk diffuse lighting, game is not working as expected. I'm currently working to resolve this issue.
